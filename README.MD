# Bookstore Application - MERN Stack

This project is a bookstore application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to view a list of books, add new books, and edit or delete existing ones.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a YouTube video titled "MERN Stack Book Store" by Mohammed Taheri.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store the book data.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework used to create the backend server and handle API requests.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library used to create the user interface (frontend) of the application.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used to execute the backend server code.

## Project Setup

1. **Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)**: Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en). This will also install npm.
2. **Install a code editor**: Choose a code editor of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.
3. **Install MongoDB**: Download and install MongoDB from the [official website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

## Project Structure

The project will have the following directory structure:

BookStore/
├── backend/
│ ├── server.js # Main backend server file
│ ├── models/ # Directory to store database models
│ └── routes/ # Directory to store API routes
└── frontend/
├── src/ # React components and application code
├── App.js # Main React application component
└── public/ # Static files like index.html
package.json # Project dependencies


## Backend Development

- **Set up Express.js server**: The `server.js` file will create an Express server, connect to the MongoDB database, and define API routes for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book data.
- **Create MongoDB models**: Define models (schemas) for the book data using Mongoose, an Object Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB in Node.js. These models will represent the structure of the documents stored in the database.

## Frontend Development

- **Create React components**: Develop React components to display the book list, create book form, and edit/delete book functionalities.
- **Fetch and display book data**: Use React's useEffect hook to fetch book data from the backend API using fetch or Axios and display it in a table.
- **Create book form**: Create a form component to allow users to add new books with title, author, and other relevant information.
- **Implement edit and delete functionalities**: Develop components and logic to handle editing and deleting existing books using API calls to the backend server.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `npm start` or `node server.js` to start the backend server.
2. **Start the frontend server**: In a separate terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm start` to start the React development server. This will usually start the application on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Deployment

This readme covers development. You can deploy the application to a production server using services like Heroku or AWS. The deployment process will involve configuring the backend server and frontend build process for the target environment.
